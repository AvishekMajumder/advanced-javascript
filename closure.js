//A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.


function stopWatch(){
    let count = 0;
    return function(){
        count ++;
        return count;
    }
}

const clock1 = stopWatch();
console.log(clock1());
console.log(clock1());
console.log(clock1());
console.log(clock1());

const clock2 = stopWatch();
console.log(clock2());
console.log(clock2());
console.log(clock1());
